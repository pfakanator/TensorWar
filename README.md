**TensorWar** is a machine learning environment made with
Unity and the ML-Agents toolkit. It pits tanks against one another, armed with
a battle ready neural network you train, and a cannon. The tanks can be user
controlled with either a keyboard or a controller. This is a WIP. It's
the first thing I've ever tried to code myself and the first time
I've used a game engine.

**Training:**

Environments run at fixed timestep 0.01 in order to better register collisions (Project Settings->Time->Fixed Timestep
= 0.01).
Currently, this repo is a simple learning environment "Battle Plane" (more in development).

## Scenes

**Battle Plane**

This is the base learning environment. Agents are given a random amount of ammunition
at the beginning of the episode and must learn to navigate, shoot and fetch more ammunition.
