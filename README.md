**TensorWar** is a machine learning game made with
Unity and the ml-agents toolkit. It pits tanks against one another, armed with
a battle ready neural network you train, and a cannon. The tanks can be user
controlled with either a keyboard or a controller. This is a WIP. It's
the first thing I've ever tried to code myself and the first time
I've used a game engine.
